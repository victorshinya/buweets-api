Buweets is an easy way to learn how to programming new APIs and services and connect to Watson APIs. This repository is initially for people who need to understand the data flow to translate a text and then send it to a natural language processing service. Here you find an API that connects your Android and iOS application to a service that analyzes and extracts emotions and sentiment from a text.
